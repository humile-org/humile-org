# Humile

**Humile is an open research community dedicated to climate and environmental data governance.**  
We focus on how local environmental data is produced, shared, and governed — across places, institutions, and technologies.

In a world increasingly driven by centralized platforms and global models, Humile exists to support **neutral data infrastructure** that respects local context, autonomy, and accountability.

---

## Why Humile exists

Environmental data is never neutral by default.

It is shaped by:
- who collects it,
- where it is generated,
- how it is validated,
- and who ultimately controls its use.

As climate and environmental data become critical to policy, markets, and public trust, governance questions are often treated as secondary — or outsourced to centralized systems that cannot reflect local realities.

Humile was created to address this gap.

We work at the intersection of:
- local environmental data,
- governance design,
- and open research practices.

## What we mean by *neutral data infrastructure*

Neutrality does not mean the absence of values.

It means:
- **no single actor owns the data layer**,  
- **local data producers retain agency**,  
- **governance rules are explicit and reviewable**,  
- **infrastructure enables plural use, not lock-in**.

Humile does not operate platforms for extraction or control.  
We document, analyze, and design **governance frameworks** that allow environmental data to be shared without being centralized.

---

## What Humile does

Humile functions as a **research and coordination layer**, not a service provider.

Our activities include:

- Publishing **Governance Notes** on environmental data systems  
- Curating open research outputs and working papers  
- Supporting **working groups** on local data governance challenges  
- Connecting practitioners, researchers, and institutions across regions  

All outputs are openly accessible and archived through public research infrastructures.

## What Humile is *not*

To avoid ambiguity, Humile is **not**:

- a data marketplace  
- a certification body  
- a consulting firm  
- a policy advocacy organization  
- a centralized data platform  

Humile does not aggregate or monetize environmental data.

---

## Governance approach

Humile operates as an open, non-profit research community.

- Research outputs are published openly  
- Governance principles are documented and versioned  
- Participation is contribution-based, not membership-based  

Decision-making focuses on:
- transparency,
- reproducibility,
- and long-term institutional trust.

More details are available in our governance notes.

---

## Publications and research

Humile publications include:
- Governance Notes
- Working papers
- Methodological reflections
- Conceptual frameworks

All publications are archived in our open repository and assigned persistent identifiers for citation.

---

## Community and working groups

Humile brings together:
- researchers,
- local practitioners,
- technologists,
- and institutional partners.

Collaboration happens through **working groups**, each focused on a specific governance challenge — such as local environmental sensing, data credibility, or cross-border data interoperability.

Participation is open and documented.
